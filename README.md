1. Inheritance:
Inheritance in JavaScript is implemented using prototype chaining. It allows objects to inherit properties and methods from other objects.

2. Abstraction:
Abstraction in JavaScript involves defining interfaces for objects, hiding the complex implementation details.
3. Encapsulation:
Encapsulation in JavaScript involves bundling data (properties) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit or class, and controlling access to them using access modifiers.
4. Polymorphism:
Polymorphism in JavaScript allows objects of different types to be treated as objects of the same type.
